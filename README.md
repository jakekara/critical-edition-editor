# Critical edition editor

Critical edition editor developed for the Yale Fortunoff Video Archive for
Holocaust Testimonies.

This is a React-based editor for creating scholarly works with footnotes
containing rich multimedia content.

This editor depends upon react-editor-js and a plugin for editor-js called
editor-js-footnotes that was developed by this author for this application.

This app is created with create-react-app. It will be incorporated into a
desktop version based on Electron in order to facilitate creating project
folders locally and moving local asset files into these folders.

## Live demo

There are two netlify demos available. One for the main branch and one for the
add-material-ui branch:
